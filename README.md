# Master-of-the-Sea
Master of the Sea is the project I have chosen to make for Mr. Cozart's Intro to Computer Programming Final. It is currently in its early development stages and hopefully will be almost complete toward the end of summer. The game is a pirate-based game in which you travel through an Open world, but currently doesn't have any objectives yet for it is still in a testing phase. Here I have written my various Milestone's and objectives during this project. 

Milestone 1: Created Window with an FPS counter.                                                                                          

Milestone 2: Created a Screen Sliding System and generated some tiles.

Milestone 3: Created a map loader capable of reading .map files and loading them into game.

Milestone 4: Created a map editor where I can create and modify .map files. Also added a menu for better UI.

Milestone 5: Added Player on screen with different sprites for each key pressed.

Milestone 6: Yes, finally added collisions.

Obstacle 1: Low frame rate because of image sizes.

Obstacle 2: .map files were corrupt because of an algorithm error which took some time to discover.

Obstacle 3: Map Editor took a while in properly writing the .map files in an uncorrupt manner.

Obstacle 4: Making menu for the map editor and trying to figure out how to properly implement it without placing tiles when clicking on menu and so on.

Obstacle 5: Making collisions is difficult because using tiles not pixels.
